Lab 1 part 2 Question:
	If n was a constant number, we would be able to create the For loop to take the maximum of 17. For example for (int i=1; i<=17; i++){}. This would make the program stop once it hits 17.
Lab 1 part 3 Question:
	You could test part two by reading the output. In Junit, you can test an expected value to a nactual value. In part 2's case, you would have to test the printed output to a own correct Fizz Buzz combination. 
Lab 1 part 4 Question:
	Between the different parts; the Class names, the input inspection, and the overall fizz buzz determination stays the same. As for what's different, let's start with how we return the results. For part 2, we simply printed out the reulsts. For part three and four, it was a little more difficult. Using the DeeptoString method to print out the array for part 3 and calling the fizzBuzzList methods in part 4. The testing was also slighty different with part 4 using Assert.assertEquals and part three using arrayEquals.
